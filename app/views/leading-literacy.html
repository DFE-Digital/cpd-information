      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course structure</h2>

      <p>The providers have based their course content on a single DfE-approved evidence-based framework.</p>

      <p>They use experienced trainers who will understand your needs. You will also get to learn alongside other teachers whose contexts are similar.</p>

      <p>The course is broken down into modules, with a mix of self-study and group coaching sessions, as well as face-to-face sessions with other teachers.</p>
      
      <p>One module will be focussed on implementation. This will give you the opportunity to plan, practise and carry out implementing a strategy in your context.</p>

      <p>There will be a 3 month window at the end of the course to write a 2,000 word response to a case study.</p>

      <p>You will need to spend between one and 2 hours per week working towards completing this NPQ. If possible, you should do this during dedicated career development time in school hours.</p>

      <p>You must complete the course to qualify for the NPQ accreditation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course funding</h2>

      <p>Full DfE funding, with no cost to the participant, is available to all teachers from:</p>

      <p>Participants will only be eligible for funding for each NPQ once.</p>
