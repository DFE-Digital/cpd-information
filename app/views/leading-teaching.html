      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Develop as a specialist in your role</h3>

      <p>You will gain an understanding of the core principles behind the science of learning, get practical tools and guidance to sequence your curriculum and plan for assessment in your specific subject and context.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Gain the skills for successful leadership</h3>

      <p>You will build the expertise to effectively manage a team of teachers and create a culture of professional learning and continuous improvement in your school.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Learn to support colleagues effectively</h3>

      <p>You will develop the skills to help colleagues plan effective lessons, meet individual pupil needs and provide opportunities for all pupils to succeed.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Learn with people from different education settings</h3>

      <p>Take advantage of training alongside a diverse group of fellow educators with lots of different perspectives. You can learn from each other's experiences and bounce ideas off each other during group sessions and collaborative practical tasks.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course structure</h2>

      <p>The providers have based their course content on a single DfE-approved evidence-based framework.</p>

      <p>They use experienced trainers who will understand your needs. You will also get to learn alongside other teachers whose contexts are similar.</p>

      <p>The course is broken down into modules, with a mix of self-study and group coaching sessions, as well as face-to-face sessions with other teachers.</p>
      
      <p>One module will be focussed on implementation. This will give you the opportunity to plan, practise and carry out implementing a strategy in your context.</p>

      <p>There will be a 3 month window at the end of the course to write a 2,000 word response to a case study.</p>

      <p>You will need to spend between one and 2 hours per week working towards completing this NPQ. If possible, you should do this during dedicated career development time in school hours.</p>

      <p>You must complete the course to qualify for the NPQ accreditation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course funding</h2>

      <p>Full DfE funding, with no cost to the participant, is available to all teachers from:</p>
