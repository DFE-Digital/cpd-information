      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How you and your school could benefit</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Ensuring all children experience success</h3>

      <p>After completing this course you will be able to develop an ambitious curriculum that meets the needs of all your learners.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Supporting colleagues to meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload</h3>

      <p>You will be taught how to provide opportunities for colleagues to share effective approaches for intervening with individuals and small groups. This means you will not have to plan different content or activities for each individual scenario.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Smoothing the admissions, exclusions and appeals process</h3>

      <p>The course will boost your understanding of how to comply with relevant laws and statutory guidance. You will also learn about creating fair and inclusive policies, processes and systems.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Managing resources effectively</h3>

      <p>You will gain knowledge about budgeting, funding and marketing. You will also be able to confidently recruit and develop the right people for your nursery.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Knowing what approaches to use</h3>

      <p>This course will help you hone your decision making skills. The techniques you learn can be applied to a range of different nursery-improvement decisions.</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Learning with people from different education settings</h3>

      <p>Take advantage of training alongside a diverse group of fellow educators with lots of different perspectives. You can learn from each others experiences and bounce ideas off each other during group sessions and collaborative practical tasks.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course structure</h2>

      <p>The providers have based their course content on a single DfE-approved evidence-based framework.</p>

      <p>They use experienced trainers who will understand your needs. You will also get to learn alongside other teachers whose contexts are similar.</p>

      <p>The course is broken down into modules, with a mix of self-study and group coaching sessions, as well as face-to-face sessions with other teachers.</p>
      
      <p>One module will be focussed on implementation. This will give you the opportunity to plan, practise and carry out implementing a strategy in your context.</p>

      <p>There will be a 3 month window at the end of the course to write a 2,000 word response to a case study.</p>

      <p>You will need to spend between one and 2 hours per week working towards completing this NPQ. If possible, you should do this during dedicated career development time in school hours.</p>

      <p>You must complete the course to qualify for the NPQ accreditation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Course funding</h2>

      <p>Full DfE funding, with no cost to the participant, is available to all teachers from:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>state-funded schools in England</li>
        <li>state-funded organisations that offer 16 to 19 places in England</li>
        <li>predominantly state-funded settings in which under-19s receive their main education</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Participants will only be eligible for funding for each NPQ once.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Next steps</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2</h3>

      <p>DfE-approved training providers work with regional delivery partners in your area to carry out the training. You and your school should select the training provider and delivery partner combination that best meets your needs.</p>
