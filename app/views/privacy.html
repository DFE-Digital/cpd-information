        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy policy</h1>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who we are and why we process personal data</h2>

      <p>We are Teacher Continuing Professional Development (TCPD), within the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

      <p>Mentions of "us" and "we" means TCPD and "you" means anyone using this service.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we look after your personal data</h2>

      <p>Any information we collect when you use this service will be used and looked after by the DfE.</p>
      <p>This means DfE is the data controller. </p>
      <p>The Professional development for teachers and leaders service is a new DfE service. We're confident that it has met our security standards, but we'll continue to run security tests as we improve the service.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>

      <p>In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one, or more, conditions in the data protection legislation.</p>

      <p>DfE processes your data under the basis of Public Task (Article 6(1)(e) of GDPR). In this case, it is necessary for the department to carry out this work, and to use the information for these purposes, to exercise its functions.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What data we collect</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Customer service systems</h3>

      <p>We use a customer service management system to process some personal data, such as feedback you send us.</p>

      <p>Zendesk is currently our preferred customer service management system because it uses various safeguards to look after your data.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Google</h3>

      <p>Weâ€™ll ask if you agree to cookies so that we can get statistics from Google Analytics. If you consent, Google may be able to get your IP address. We use Google Analytics for statistics and will not identify you personally from these.</p>

      <P>We also use Google's G Suite to process some personal data. Google processes your data according to our instructions.</P>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hosting services</h3>

      <p>We host our services on GOV.UK PaaS, which encrypts your data to prevent it being accessed by unauthorised people.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why we need your data</h2>

      <p>We collect your personal data in order to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>gather feedback to improve this service</li>
        <li>respond to any feedback you send us, if you've asked us to</li>
        <li>send email alerts to users who request them</li>
        <li>monitor use of the site to identify security threats</li>
        <li>monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and JavaScript errors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We use the information we collect through Google Analytics to see how you use GOV.UK and to see how well the site performs on your device.</p>

      <p>We do this to help:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>make sure this service is meeting the needs of its users</li>
        <li>make improvements, for example improving site search</li>
        <li>make performance improvements, for example improving page load time and data usage</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We combine Google Analytics information with similar data from other DfE digital services to help understand and improve user journeys.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Our legal basis for processing your data</h2>

      <p>The legal basis for processing personal data in relation to site security is our legitimate interests, and the legitimate interests of our users, in ensuring the security and integrity of this service.</p>

      <p>The legal basis for processing data collected with Google Analytics is your consent.</p>

      <p>The legal basis for processing all other personal data is that it's necessary:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to perform a task in the public interest</li>
        <li>in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we do with your data</h2>

      <p>The data we collect may be shared with other government departments, agencies and public bodies. It may also be shared with our technology suppliers, for example our hosting provider.</p>

      <p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

      <p>The data we collect with Google Analytics cookies is transferred and stored with Google where we analyse it with Google Analytics software (Universal Analytics). We do not allow Google to use or share this data for their own purposes.</p>

      <P>We will not:</P>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
        <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How long we keep your data</h2>

      <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as it is needed for the purposes set out in this document or for as long as the law requires us to.</p>

      <p>We will:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>keep your feedback data for 2 years</li>
        <li>delete access log data which contain your IP address after 120 days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

      <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it's processed and when it's stored.</p>

      <p>All personal data is stored in the European Economic Area (EEA). Data collected by Google Analytics may be transferred outside the EEA for processing.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>

      <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>

      <p>We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Your rights</h2>
